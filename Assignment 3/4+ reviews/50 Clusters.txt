270727                          Nice, but not spectacular   
270933                     Smells Good, Tastes Good . . .   
378253    Smooth pleasant flavor- better than VIA vanilla

270621                                        Good Blend.

270588           Coffee is fabulous without cream & sugar   
378115           Not as good as their unflavored coffees.

241757                                Would not recommend   
241697                           Wonderful aroma & flavor   
241753                              Bold flavor, but. . .   
85574                                 cracker gluten free   
241722                                       Skunk-fest!!

241676                       Highly Recommened A Must Try   
85579                                   Terrific crackers   
241731            By far, not your average cup of coffee.
